# osTicket Lab on Azure

## Objective
In this lab, I deploy and configure osTicket on a Windows Server VM using XAMPP (Apache + PHP), running on Microsoft Azure Cloud. I also configured access controls via an NSG
(Network Security Groups), allowing only http(s)(port 80/433) and Remote Desktop Protocol (port 3389) from only my Host computer's IP address. 
<br> 
The goal was to explore VM deployment via Microsoft Azure and gain hands-on experience with a ticketing system, familiarizing myself with opening and assigning tickets, 
provisioning SLAs, setting priority, and commenting/closing tickets. Through the process of setting up this self-hosted platform, I also learned and practiced basic firewall 
hardening and enforcing least-privilege access!
